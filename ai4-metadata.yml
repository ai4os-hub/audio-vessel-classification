summary: "Classifies the distance to the nearest vessel from a 10-second underwater audio recording using a deep learning model."
description: |-
  audio_vessel_classifier is an AI application that uses underwater acoustic data to estimate the distance to the nearest vessel.
  It leverages the DEEPaaS API for model serving and supports two pre-trained deep learning models: a feature extraction model and a fine-tuning model.
  Users can choose between uploading a raw 10-second audio file or a pre-computed embedding.

  The models are based on CLAP-LAION (Biolingual) and are suitable for marine monitoring, acoustic analysis, and environmental applications.

  After launching the service, users can choose which model to use:
  - `fine_tuning`: more accurate, re-trained end-to-end
  - `feature_extraction`: more efficient, using frozen backbone and custom classification head
