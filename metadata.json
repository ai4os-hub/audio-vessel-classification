    "audio-vessel-classifier is an application using the DEEPaaS API. Upload your 10-second .wav file and receive a prediction indicating the distance range to the nearest vessel.\n",
    "The classifier is based on a convolutional neural network trained on underwater sound recordings. It categorizes the distance of the closest vessel into discrete classes (e.g., 0–1 km, 1–2 km, ..., 9–10 km, >10 km) based on acoustic features. This tool is designed to support marine monitoring efforts by providing automated vessel presence estimation from passive acoustic data."
